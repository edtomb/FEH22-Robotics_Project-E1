# FEH22-Robotics_Project-E1
This code was written as part for a group robotics project as part of Ohio State's Fundamentals of Engineering Honors cirriculum. It is
written in C++ and designed to run on the FEH Proteus. 

The goal of the project was to design a robot that would manuver around a diner themed course as pictured below, completing various tasks along the way, such as flipping a burger, dispensing soft serve, returning a tray to the sink, changing the song on a jukebox, and sliding an order ticket. 
This project was done in collaboration with my amazing teamates, Sammy Aidja, Jack Behling, and Kailash Sastry, without whom this would not have been possible.

The robot itsself makes use of a local positioning system, pinwheel and optosensor shaft encoders, a line following circuit, and multiple servos. It was assembled entirely from factory parts without the use of any kits. The total production cost of the robot was $117, $43 under the maximum budget of $160.
