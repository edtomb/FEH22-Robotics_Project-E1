# Ohio State Fundamentals of Engineering Honors Robotics Project

This code was developed as part of a group robotics project within Ohio State's Fundamentals of Engineering Honors curriculum. It is written in C++ and designed to run on the FEH Proteus.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design a robot capable of navigating a diner-themed course, completing various tasks such as:

- Flipping a burger
- Dispensing soft serve
- Returning a tray to the sink
- Changing the song on a jukebox
- Sliding an order ticket

## Robot Design

The robot incorporates several key features:

- Local positioning system
- Pinwheel and optosensor shaft encoders
- Line-following circuit
- Multiple servos

The robot was assembled entirely from factory parts without the use of any kits. The total production cost was $117, which is $43 under the maximum budget of $160.

## Competition Results

The robot competed in the final competition on April 9, 2022. Out of 65 teams, our robot placed in the top 16 during the bracket tournament.

## Code and Documentation

Feel free to explore the code and review the inline documentation. I am always aspiring to become a better programmer, so I welcome any comments, questions, or suggestions you have about this project.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed in collaboration with my amazing teammates:

- Sammy Aidja
- Jack Behling
- Kailash Sastry

Without their efforts, this project would not have been possible.

Special thanks to the creators of the FEH Proteus and FEH Proteus firmware, the FEH instructional staff, and our instructor, Paul Clingan, whose support made the long hours we put into this project worthwhile.
